## Purpose
Many beginner gardeners do not know where to start when it comes to their new hobby. How much soil should I use? How much sunlight do these plants need? Do I need to water them every day? These are all questions Seedly aims to answer by streamlining the process of researching the plants a person would like to grow.

## End User
