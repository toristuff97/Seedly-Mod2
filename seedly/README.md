# Seedly

## Purpose
Many beginner gardeners do not know where to start when it comes to their new hobby. How much soil should I use? How much sunlight do these plants need? Do I need to water them every day? These are all questions Seedly aims to answer by streamlining the process of researching the plants a person would like to grow.

## Expected roadblocks
I can see the login/registration for the site being a little difficult, I don't know Firebase (yet) so that's definitely a must. Also setting up the search function may be tough, worst case scenario I would just consolidate adding a new plant into the Explore function so that the search bar wouldn't even be an issue. Also time, but that is always the case.
